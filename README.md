## What is HushType?

HushType is a **privacy-first, macOS-native speech-to-text application** that lets you dictate text into any app where your cursor is active — without ever sending your voice to the cloud.

Unlike cloud-dependent alternatives (MacWhisper, Superwhisper, Apple Dictation), HushType runs entirely offline using local AI models:

- **[whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)** for speech recognition with Metal GPU acceleration
- **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)** for intelligent text post-processing with local LLMs

The app lives in your macOS menu bar and provides global hotkey-activated dictation with six purpose-built processing modes — from raw transcription to LLM-powered text structuring, grammar correction, and prompt formatting.

> **Hush** = your voice stays private, never leaving your device
> **Type** = text appears at your cursor

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Zero-Network Architecture** | All speech recognition and LLM processing happens locally. No cloud, no telemetry, no data leaves your Mac. |
| **Dual Local AI Pipeline** | whisper.cpp (STT) + llama.cpp (LLM) in one app — a unique combination no competitor offers. |
| **Six Processing Modes** | Raw, Clean, Structure, Prompt, Code, and Custom modes for every use case. |
| **Universal Text Injection** | Dictate into any macOS app — terminals, browsers, IDEs, Slack, and more. |
| **Voice Commands** | Launch apps, manage windows, and control your Mac with voice. |
| **App-Aware Context** | Auto-selects formatting mode based on the active application. |
| **Editable Overlay** | Review and edit transcribed text in a floating window before injection. |
| **90+ Languages** | Full multilingual support with automatic language detection. |

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| UI Framework | Swift 5.9+ / SwiftUI / AppKit |
| Speech Recognition | whisper.cpp (C/C++) with Metal acceleration |
| LLM Inference | llama.cpp (C/C++) with Metal acceleration |
| Audio Capture | AVAudioEngine |
| Text Injection | CGEvent API / Clipboard |
| Local Storage | SwiftData |
| Build System | Xcode 15+ / Swift Package Manager / CMake |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Auto-Updates | Sparkle |
| Distribution | DMG / Homebrew Cask |

## Quick Start

### Install via Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install --cask hushtype
```

### Install from GitHub Releases

1. Download the latest `.dmg` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hushtype/hushtype/releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag HushType to Applications
3. Launch HushType from Applications

### First Run

1. **Grant Permissions** — HushType will request Accessibility and Microphone permissions
2. **Download a Model** — Open Settings and download a Whisper model (recommended: `small` for balanced speed/accuracy)
3. **Set Your Hotkey** — Default is double-tap Fn or hold Right Option
4. **Start Dictating** — Press your hotkey, speak, and release. Text appears at your cursor.

> 💡 For detailed setup instructions, see the [Quick Start Guide](docs/getting-started/QUICK_START.md).

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hushtype/hushtype.git
cd hushtype

# Build whisper.cpp and llama.cpp
./scripts/build-deps.sh

# Open in Xcode
open HushType.xcodeproj

# Build and run (⌘R)
```

> See the full [Setup Guide](docs/getting-started/SETUP_GUIDE.md) for prerequisites and detailed instructions.

## Processing Modes

HushType's dual AI pipeline gives you six modes for different use cases:

| Mode | What It Does | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Raw** | No LLM processing — inject speech exactly as recognized | Quick notes, real-time chat |
| **Clean** | Fix spelling, grammar, punctuation, capitalization | Emails, messages, documents |
| **Structure** | Format as bullet lists, numbered steps, or tables | Meeting notes, outlines |
| **Prompt** | Reformat speech into clear, well-structured AI prompts | Claude, ChatGPT, LLM tools |
| **Code** | Format as code comments, commit messages, docstrings | Development workflows |
| **Custom** | User-defined prompt templates | Anything you need |
